## Just the basics
Examples of flings, springs, and combinations of the two. 

- Simple fling
- Different friction examples
- Touch (drag) to spring
- Simple spring
- Touch (drag) to spring
- Different damping and friction demonstrations

## Combining dynamic animations
### Subsequent animations
Examples where momentum is carried from one animation to another.

- Bounce off wall (fling to fling)
- Fling to spring (stick to wall, like Facebook's chat heads)

### Simultaneous animations
Examples where animations simultaneously interact.

- Chained springs (balls)
- Chained springs (UI example) *
